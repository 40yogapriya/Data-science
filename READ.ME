📈 Forecasting House Prices Using Smart Regression Techniques

📝 Project Description

This project focuses on accurately predicting house prices using advanced regression techniques. By leveraging feature engineering, data preprocessing, and smart regression models like **Random Forest**, **Gradient Boosting**, and **XGBoost**, this project aims to improve the predictive performance on housing datasets. It is ideal for those looking to apply machine learning to real-world pricing problems in real estate.



🔑 Key Features

* **Robust Preprocessing Pipeline:** Missing value imputation, outlier handling, feature encoding, and scaling.
* **Smart Feature Engineering:** Derived variables such as age of house, renovation years, and location-based features.
* **Model Selection:** Comparison of multiple regression models (Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, Random Forest, XGBoost).
* **Hyperparameter Tuning:** GridSearchCV and cross-validation techniques to find the best model.
* **Performance Metrics:** MAE, RMSE, R² score for evaluation.
* **Visualization:** Correlation heatmaps, error distributions, and prediction vs actual plots.
